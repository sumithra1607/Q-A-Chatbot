Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5- week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may",

The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule. Reassess the risk of TLS when reinitiating VENCLEXTA after a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up.

The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA may be delivered using any of the approved tablet strengths (e.g., patients can take 2 x 50 mg tablets or 10 x 10 mg tablets instead of 1 x 100 mg tablet as needed). If the patient misses a dose of VENCLEXTA within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, instruct the patient to take the missed dose as soon as",

VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the ramp-up phase in all patients, and during reinitiation after dosage interruption in patients with CLL/SLL. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS, including fatal cases, has been reported after a single 20 mg dose of VENCLEXTA. In patients with CLL/SLL who followed the current (5-week) dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the",

The rate of TLS remained consistent with VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab. With a 2- to 3-week dose ramp-up and higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included deaths and renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS in patients with CLL/SLL. Assess all patients for risk and provide appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics. Monitor blood chemistries and manage abnormalities promptly. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases.

It is a light yellow to dark yellow solid with the empirical formula C45H50ClN7O7S and a molecular weight of 868.44. Venetoclax is described chemically as 4-(4-{[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl]methyl}piperazin-1-yl)-N-({3- nitro-4-[(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)amino]phenyl}sulfonyl)-2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin- 5-yloxy)benzamide) and has the following chemical structure: Venetoclax has very low aqueous solubility. VENCLEXTA tablets for oral use are supplied as pale yellow or beige tablets that contain 10, 50, or 100 mg venetoclax as the active ingredient. Each tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, polysorbate 80, sodium stearyl fumarate, and calcium phosphate dibasic. In addition, the 10 mg and 100 mg coated tablets include the following: iron oxide yellow, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, talc, and titanium dioxide. The 50 mg coated tablets also include the following: iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, iron oxide black, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, polyethylene glycol and titanium dioxide.

Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL and AML cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer",

Based on the exposure response analyses for safety, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of some safety events was observed in clinical studies in patients with AML. No exposure-safety relationship was observed in patients with CLL/SLL at doses up to 1200 mg given as monotherapy and up to 600 mg given in combination with rituximab. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of VENCLEXTA up to 1200 mg once daily (2 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial in 176 patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. VENCLEXTA had no large effect on QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) and there was no relationship between venetoclax exposure and change in QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Venetoclax mean (± standard deviation) steady state Cmax was 2.1 ± 1.1 mcg/mL and AUC0-24h was 32.8 ±",

Following a 4-week dosing period and subsequent 4-week recovery period, minimal single-cell necrosis was still present in some tissues and reversibility has not been assessed following longer periods of dosing or recovery. In addition, after approximately 3 months of daily dosing in dogs, venetoclax caused progressive white discoloration of the hair coat due to loss of melanin pigment. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma In Combination with Obinutuzumab CLL14 (BO25323) was a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open-label, actively controlled trial (NCT02242942) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) for patients with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min).
