Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use. • Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. • Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. The risks and benefits of treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and",

The most frequent serious infections reported with RINVOQ included pneumonia and cellulitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, were reported with RINVOQ. A higher rate of serious infections was observed with RINVOQ 30 mg compared to RINVOQ 15 mg. Avoid use of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients: • with chronic or recurrent infection • who have been exposed to tuberculosis • with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection • who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or • with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection.

Most reports described anatomic (e.g., ileostomy, colostomy, intestinal resection) or functional gastrointestinal conditions with shortened gastrointestinal transit times. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if medication residue is observed repeatedly. Monitor patients clinically and consider alternative treatment if there is an inadequate therapeutic response. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] • Mortality [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] • Gastrointestinal Perforations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] • Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because",

Monitor patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, pJIA, or giant cell arteritis closely for adverse reactions when co-administering RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. For patients with atopic dermatitis, coadministration of RINVOQ 30 mg once daily with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. For patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, reduce the RINVOQ induction dosage to 30 mg once daily. The recommended maintenance dosage is 15 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Upadacitinib exposure is decreased when it is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampin), which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ exposure occurs during pregnancy, healthcare providers or patients should report the pregnancy by calling 1-800-633-9110. Risk Summary Available data from the pharmacovigilance safety database and postmarketing case reports on use of RINVOQ in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Based on animal studies, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ has the potential to adversely affect a developing fetus. Advise patients of reproductive potential and pregnant patients of the potential risk to the fetus.

The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.

JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression.

Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Upadacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In a cell-free isolated enzyme assay, upadacitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1 and JAK2 relative to JAK3 and TYK2. In human leukocyte cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1 and JAK1/JAK3 more potently than JAK2/JAK2 mediated STAT phosphorylation. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of IL-6 Induced STAT3 and IL-7 Induced STAT5 Phosphorylation In healthy volunteers, the administration of upadacitinib (immediate release formulation) resulted in a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2)-induced STAT3 and IL-7 (JAK1/JAK3)-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in whole blood.

Potential for Upadacitinib to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that upadacitinib does not inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) at clinically relevant concentrations.

No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male or female rats that received upadacitinib for up to 101 weeks at oral doses up to 15 or 20 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 4 and 10 times the 15 mg tablet dose, 2 and 5 times the 30 mg tablet dose, and 1.6 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 45 mg on an AUC basis, respectively). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male or female Tg.rasH2 mice that received upadacitinib for 26 weeks at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. Mutagenesis Upadacitinib tested negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames assay), in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.

However, maintenance of pregnancy was adversely affected at oral doses of 25 mg/kg/day and 75 mg/kg/day based upon dose-related findings of increased post-implantation losses (increased resorptions) and decreased numbers of mean viable embryos per litter (approximately 22 and 84 times the 15 mg tablet dose, 11 and 43 times the 30 mg tablet dose, and 8 and 31 times the MRHD on an AUC basis, respectively). The number of viable embryos was unaffected in female rats that received upadacitinib at an oral dose of 5 mg/kg/day and were mated to males that received the same dose (approximately 2 times the 15 mg dose, 0.9 times the 30 mg dose, and at 0.6 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 15 mg once daily were assessed in five Phase 3 randomized, double-blind,",

Overall, 57% of the patients were male and 69% were white. The mean age at baseline was 34 years (ranged from 12 to 75 years) and 13% of the patients were 12 to less than 18 years. At baseline, 49% of patients had a vIGA-AD score of 3 (moderate AD), and 51% of patients had a vIGA-AD score of 4 (severe AD). The baseline mean EASI score was 29 and the baseline weekly average Worst Pruritus NRS score was 7. Approximately 52% of the patients had prior exposure to systemic AD treatment. In all three trials, patients received RINVOQ once daily oral doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, or matching placebo for 16 weeks.

Safety and efficacy of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ were also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 83 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis (NCT03725007). The pJIA patient subtypes at study entry included rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular (68.7%), rheumatoid factor positive polyarticular (15.7%), extended oligoarticular (13.3%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (2.4%). All patients received RINVOQ LQ or RINVOQ tablet dosages based on weight for up to 156 weeks. Patients treated with a stable dose of MTX were permitted to enter the study; changes in MTX dose were permitted during the study. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 48. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 14.9 Giant Cell Arteritis The efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 15 mg once daily were assessed in Trial GCA (NCT03725202), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in patients 50 years of age and older (81.8% were 65 years of age and older, 73.1% were female,",

RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ can cause serious side effects, including: 1. Serious Infections. RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ is a medicine that affects your immune system. RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections.  Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ.  Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ.  You should not start taking RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).  Before starting RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, tell your healthcare provider if you: o are being treated for an infection. o have had an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back. o",
