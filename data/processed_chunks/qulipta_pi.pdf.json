Reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema, have been reported with use of QULIPTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Hypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with QULIPTA for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of QULIPTA is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5.3 Raynaud’s Phenomenon Development of Raynaud’s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. QULIPTA should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",

The safety of QULIPTA was evaluated in 2657 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of QULIPTA. Of these, 1225 patients were exposed to QULIPTA for at least 6 months, and 826 patients were exposed for 12 months. In the 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 314 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 10 mg once daily, 411 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 30 mg once daily, 678 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 60 mg once daily, and 663 patients received placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1-833-277-0206 or visiting http://empresspregnancyregistry.com. Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of QULIPTA in pregnant women. In animal studies, oral administration of atogepant during the period of organogenesis (rats and rabbits) or throughout pregnancy and lactation (rats) resulted in adverse developmental effects (decreased fetal and offspring body weight in rats; increased incidence of fetal structural variations in rabbits) at exposures greater than those used clinically [see Data].

The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Data Animal Data Oral administration of atogepant (0, 5, 15, 125, or 750 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreases in fetal body weight and in skeletal ossification at the two highest doses tested (125 and 750 mg/kg), which were not associated with maternal toxicity.

Clinical studies of QULIPTA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Atogepant displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics up to 170 mg per day (approximately 3 times the highest recommended dosage), with no accumulation. Effect of Food When QULIPTA was administered with a high-fat meal, the food effect was not significant (AUC and Cmax were reduced by approximately 18% and 22%, respectively, with no effect on median time to maximum atogepant plasma concentration). QULIPTA was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies. Distribution Plasma protein binding of atogepant was not concentration-dependent in the range of 0.1 to 10 µM; the unbound fraction of atogepant was approximately 4.7% in human plasma. The mean apparent volume of distribution of atogepant (Vz/F) after oral administration is approximately 292 L. Elimination Metabolism Atogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. The parent compound (atogepant), and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite (M23) were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma.

The parent compound (atogepant), and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite (M23) were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma. Excretion The elimination half-life of atogepant is approximately 11 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of atogepant is approximately 19 L/hr. Following single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-atogepant to healthy male subjects, 42% and 5% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atogepant in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of atogepant in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-89 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal function (CLcr >90 mL/min). Patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD; CLcr <30 mL/min) have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Due to a potential for liver injury in patients with severe hepatic impairment, avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Other Specific Populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and body weight did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (Cmax and AUC) of atogepant. Therefore, no dose adjustments are warranted based on these factors. Drug Interactions In Vitro Studies Enzymes In vitro, atogepant is not an inhibitor for CYPs 3A4, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant does not inhibit MAO-A or UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant is not anticipated to be a clinically significant perpetrator of drug-drug interactions through CYP450s, MAO-A, or UGT1A1 inhibition. Atogepant is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporters Atogepant is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OAT1.
