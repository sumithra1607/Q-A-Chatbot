Complete dissolution does not occur in all patients and recurrence of stones within 5 years has been observed in up to 50% of patients who do dissolve their stones on bile acid therapy. Patients should be carefully selected for therapy with ursodiol, and alternative therapies should be considered. DESCRIPTION Actigall is a bile acid available as 300 mg capsules suitable for oral administration. Actigall is ursodiol, USP (ursodeoxycholic acid), a naturally occurring bile acid found in small quantities in normal human bile and in the biles of certain other mammals. It is a bitter-tasting, white powder freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and glacial acetic acid; sparingly soluble in chloroform; slightly soluble in ether; and insoluble in water. The chemical name for ursodiol is 3α,7β-Dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (C24H40O4). Ursodiol, USP has a molecular weight of 392.57. Its structure is shown below: Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, and starch (corn). Gelatin capsules contain ferric oxide, gelatin, and titanium dioxide. The capsules are printed with edible ink containing black iron oxide. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY About 90% of a therapeutic dose of Actigall is"}

The capsules are printed with edible ink containing black iron oxide. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY About 90% of a therapeutic dose of Actigall is absorbed in the small bowel after oral administration. After absorption, ursodiol enters the portal vein and undergoes efficient extraction from portal blood by the liver (i.e., there is a large “first-pass” effect) where it is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and is then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts.

Only small quantities of ursodiol appear in the systemic circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The sites of the drug’s therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen. Beyond conjugation, ursodiol is not altered or catabolized appreciably by the liver or intestinal mucosa. A small proportion of orally administered drug undergoes bacterial degradation with each cycle of enterohepatic circulation. Ursodiol can be both oxidized and reduced at the 7- carbon, yielding either 7-keto-lithocholic acid or lithocholic acid, respectively. Further, there is some bacterially catalyzed deconjugation of glyco- and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid in the small bowel. Free ursodiol, 7-keto-lithocholic acid, and lithocholic acid are relatively insoluble in aqueous media and larger proportions of these compounds are lost from the distal gut into the feces. Reabsorbed free ursodiol is reconjugated by the liver. Eighty percent of lithocholic acid formed in the small bowel is excreted in the feces, but the 20% that is absorbed is sulfated at the 3-hydroxyl group in the liver to relatively insoluble lithocholyl conjugates which are excreted into bile and lost in feces.

Absorbed 7-keto-lithocholic acid is stereospecifically reduced in the liver to chenodiol. Lithocholic acid causes cholestatic liver injury and can cause death from liver failure in certain species unable to form sulfate conjugates. Lithocholic acid is formed by 7-dehydroxylation of the dihydroxy bile acids (ursodiol and chenodiol) in the gut lumen. The 7-dehydroxylation reaction appears to be alpha-specific, i.e., chenodiol is more efficiently 7-dehydroxylated than ursodiol and, for equimolar doses of ursodiol and chenodiol, levels of lithocholic acid appearing in bile are lower with the former. Man has the capacity to sulfate lithocholic acid. Although liver injury has not been associated with ursodiol therapy, a reduced capacity to sulfate may exist in some individuals, but such a deficiency has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

Pharmacodynamics Ursodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis and secretion of cholesterol, and also inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol. It appears to have little inhibitory effect on synthesis and secretion into bile of endogenous bile acids, and does not appear to affect secretion of phospholipids into bile. With repeated dosing, bile ursodeoxycholic acid concentrations reach a steady-state in about 3 weeks. Although insoluble in aqueous media, cholesterol can be solubilized in at least two different ways in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids. In addition to solubilizing cholesterol in micelles, ursodiol acts by an apparently unique mechanism to cause dispersion of cholesterol as liquid crystals in aqueous media. Thus, even though administration of high doses (e.g., 15 -18 mg/kg/day) does not result in a concentration of ursodiol higher than 60% of the total bile acid pool, ursodiol-rich bile effectively solubilizes cholesterol. The overall effect of ursodiol is to increase the concentration level at which saturation of cholesterol occurs. The various actions of ursodiol combine to change the bile of patients with gallstones from cholesterol-precipitating to cholesterol-solubilizing, thus resulting in bile conducive to cholesterol stone dissolution.

With an Actigall dose of about 10 mg/kg/day, complete stone dissolution can be anticipated in about 30% of unselected patients with uncalcified gallstones < 20 mm in maximal diameter treated for up to 2 years. Patients with calcified gallstones prior to treatment, or patients who develop stone calcification or gallbladder nonvisualization on treatment, and patients with stones > 20 mm in maximal diameter rarely dissolve their stones. The chance of gallstone dissolution is increased up to 50% in patients with floating or floatable stones (i.e., those with high cholesterol content), and is inversely related to stone size for those < 20 mm in maximal diameter.

A nonvisualizing gallbladder by oral cholecystogram prior to the initiation of therapy is not a contraindication to Actigall therapy (the group of patients with nonvisualizing gallbladders in the Actigall studies had complete stone dissolution rates similar to the group of patients with visualizing gallbladders). However, gallbladder nonvisualization developing during ursodiol treatment predicts failure of complete stone dissolution and in such cases therapy should be discontinued. Partial stone dissolution occurring within 6 months of beginning therapy with Actigall appears to be associated with a > 70% chance of eventual complete stone dissolution with further treatment; partial dissolution observed within 1 year of starting therapy indicates a 40% probability of complete dissolution.

Allergy to bile acids. PRECAUTIONS Liver Tests Ursodiol therapy has not been associated with liver damage. Lithocholic acid, a naturally occurring bile acid, is known to be a liver-toxic metabolite. This bile acid is formed in the gut from ursodiol less efficiently and in smaller amounts than that seen from chenodiol. Lithocholic acid is detoxified in the liver by sulfation and, although man appears to be an efficient sulfater, it is possible that some patients may have a congenital or acquired deficiency in sulfation, thereby predisposing them to lithocholate-induced liver damage.

Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with Actigall in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid- lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion, and encourage cholesterol gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of Actigall. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ursodeoxycholic acid was tested in 2-year oral carcinogenicity studies in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats at daily doses of 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. It was not tumorigenic in mice. In the rat study, it produced statistically significant dose-related increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of adrenal medulla in males (p = 0.014, Peto trend test) and females (p = 0.004, Peto trend test).

A patient being treated with Atelvia should not receive ACTONEL. 5.2 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ACTONEL, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ACTONEL is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers) [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17.1)]. Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ACTONEL and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail"}

Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2)]."}
{"file": "actonel_pi.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "6 In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ACTONEL should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.3 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ACTONEL. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ACTONEL therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients, especially in patients with Paget’s disease in whom bone turnover is significantly elevated [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17.1)]. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ACTONEL. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (for example, tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (for example, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (for example, periodontal"}

The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain in patients taking bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are traverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should"}

Endoscopic Findings: In the ACTONEL clinical trials, endoscopic evaluation was encouraged in any patient with moderate-to-severe gastrointestinal complaints, while maintaining the blind. Endoscopies were performed on equal numbers of patients between the placebo and treated groups [75 (14.5%) placebo; 75 (11.9%) ACTONEL]. Clinically important findings (perforations, ulcers, or bleeding) among this symptomatic population were similar between groups (51% placebo; 39% ACTONEL).

Discontinue ACTONEL when pregnancy is recognized. In animal reproduction studies, daily oral administration of risedronate to pregnant rats during organogenesis decreased neonatal survival and body weight at doses approximately 5 and 26 times, respectively, the highest recommended human daily dose of 30 mg (based on body surface area, mg/m2). A low incidence of cleft palate was observed in fetuses of dams treated at doses approximately equal to the 30 mg human daily dose. Delayed skeletal ossification was observed in fetuses of dams treated at approximately 2.5 to 5 times the 30 mg human daily dose. Periparturient mortality due to maternal hypocalcemia occurred in dams and neonates upon daily oral administration of risedronate to pregnant rats during mating and/or gestation starting at doses equivalent to the 30 mg daily human dose.

Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone and available for release into the systemic circulation is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Consequently, based on the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates, there is a potential risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on this risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

A small degree of lacteal transfer occurred in nursing rats. The concentration of the drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.

Each ACTONEL tablet for oral administration contains the equivalent of 5, 30, 35, 75, or 150 mg of anhydrous risedronate sodium in the form of the hemi-pentahydrate with small amounts of monohydrate. The empirical formula for risedronate sodium hemi-pentahydrate is C7H10NO7P2Na •2.5 H2O. The chemical name of risedronate sodium is [1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylidene]bis[phosphonic acid] monosodium salt. The chemical structure of risedronate sodium hemi-pentahydrate is the following: Molecular Weight: Anhydrous: 305.10 Hemi-pentahydrate: 350.13 Risedronate sodium is a fine, white to off-white, odorless, crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and in aqueous solutions, and essentially insoluble in common organic solvents. Inactive Ingredients All dose strengths contain: crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide. Dose strength-specific ingredients include: 5 mg—ferric oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate; 30 mg—lactose monohydrate; 35 mg—ferric oxide red, ferric oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate; 75 mg—ferric oxide red; 150 mg—FD&C blue #2 aluminum lake. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ACTONEL has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as an antiresorptive agent.

At the cellular level, ACTONEL inhibits osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface, but show evidence of reduced active resorption (for example, lack of ruffled border). Histomorphometry in rats, dogs, and minipigs showed that ACTONEL treatment reduces bone turnover (activation frequency, that is, the rate at which bone remodeling sites are activated) and bone resorption at remodeling sites.

In clinical trials, administration of ACTONEL to postmenopausal women resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (markers of bone resorption) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation). At the 5 mg dose, decreases in deoxypyridinoline/creatinine were evident within 14 days of treatment. Changes in bone formation markers were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and bone formation; decreases in bone- specific alkaline phosphatase of about 20% were evident within 3 months of treatment. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of about 40% below baseline values by the sixth month of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Bone turnover is decreased as early as 14 days and maximally within about 6 months of treatment, with achievement of a new steady-state that more nearly approximates the rate of bone turnover seen in premenopausal women.

Osteoporosis in Men In a 2-year study of men with osteoporosis, treatment with ACTONEL 35 mg once-a-week resulted in a mean decrease from baseline compared to placebo of 16% (placebo 20%; ACTONEL 35 mg 37%) for the bone resorption marker urinary collagen cross-linked N- telopeptide, 45% (placebo -6%; ACTONEL 35 mg 39%) for the bone resorption marker serum C-telopeptide, and 27% (placebo -2%; ACTONEL 35 mg 25%) for the bone formation marker serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis Osteoporosis with glucocorticoid use occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss.

Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma.

There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that ACULAR® ophthalmic solution be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time. 5.4 Corneal Effects Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ACULAR® solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: Because of the known effects of prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), the use of ACULAR® solution during late pregnancy should be avoided. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ACULAR® is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 2 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 11 DESCRIPTION ACULAR® (ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution) 0.5% is a member of the pyrrolo- pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for ophthalmic use.

These doses are approximately 125 times and 50 times higher respectively than the maximum recommended human topical ophthalmic daily dose given as QID for itching to affected eyes on a mg/kg basis. Ketorolac tromethamine was not mutagenic in vitro in the Ames assay or in forward mutation assays. Similarly, it did not result in an in vitro increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis or an in vivo increase in chromosome breakage in mice. However, ketorolac tromethamine did result in an increased incidence in chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells."}

These doses are respectively 225 and 400 times higher than the typical human topical ophthalmic daily dose. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two controlled clinical studies showed that ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution was significantly more effective than its vehicle in relieving ocular itching caused by seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Two controlled clinical studies showed that patients treated for two weeks with ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution were less likely to have measurable signs of inflammation (cell and flare) than patients treated with its vehicle. Results from clinical studies indicate that ketorolac tromethamine has no significant effect upon intraocular pressure; however, changes in intraocular pressure may occur following cataract surgery. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING ACULAR® (ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution) 0.5% is supplied sterile, in white opaque plastic LDPE bottles with white droppers, with gray high impact polystyrene (HIPS) caps as follows: 5 mL in 10 mL bottle NDC 0023-2181-05 Storage: Store at 15°-25°C (59°-77°F).

Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who either have a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs. 5.3 Increased Bleeding Time With some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that ACUVAIL be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time. 5.4 Corneal Effects Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis."}

In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health."}
{"file": "acuvail_pi.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.5 Risk of Contamination Avoid allowing the tip of the single-dose vial to contact the eye or surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections or cause injury to the eye.

One drop of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution was instilled into 1 eye and 1 drop of vehicle into the other eye three times daily in 26 healthy subjects. Five (5) of 26 subjects had detectable concentrations of ketorolac in their plasma (range 11 to 23 ng/mL) at Day 10 during topical ocular treatment. The range of concentrations following three times daily dosing of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution are approximately 4 to 8% of the steady state mean minimum plasma concentration observed following four times daily oral administration of 10 mg ketorolac in humans (290 ± 70 ng/mL). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel group comparison studies including approximately 500 patients were conducted to evaluate the effects of ACUVAIL on anterior chamber cell and flare, and ocular pain relief following cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.

Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. BENTYL may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking BENTYL."}

It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of BENTYL in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Other Drugs with Anticholinergic Activity The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including BENTYL: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. 7.3 Other Gastrointestinal Motility Drugs Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. 7.4 Effect of Antacids Because antacids may interfere with the absorption"}

However, epidemiologic studies did not show an increased risk of structural malformations among babies born to women who took products containing dicyclomine hydrochloride at doses up to 40 mg/day during the first trimester of pregnancy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose based on 160 mg/day (3 mg/kg) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dicyclomine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers BENTYL is contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from BENTYL, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."}

BENTYL is contraindicated in infants less than 6 months of age [see Contraindications (4)]. There are published cases reporting that the administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride to infants has been followed by serious respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, shortness of breath, breathlessness, respiratory collapse, apnea and asphyxia), seizures, syncope, pulse rate fluctuations, muscular hypotonia, and coma, and death, however; no causal relationship has been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BENTYL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range in adults, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

It is soluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol and chloroform, and very slightly soluble in ether. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dicyclomine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies indicate that this action is achieved via a dual mechanism: • a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites with approximately 1/8 the milligram potency of atropine (in vitro, guinea pig ileum); and • a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic) as evidenced by dicyclomine’s antagonism of bradykinin- and histamine- induced spasms of the isolated guinea pig ileum. Atropine did not affect responses to these two agonists. In vivo studies in cats and dogs showed dicyclomine to be equally potent against acetylcholine (ACh)- or barium chloride (BaCl2)-induced intestinal spasm while atropine was at least 200 times more potent against effects of ACh than BaCl2. Tests for mydriatic effects in mice showed that dicyclomine was approximately 1/500 as potent as atropine; antisialagogue tests in rabbits showed"}

Mean volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is approximately 3.65 L/kg suggesting extensive distribution in tissues. Elimination The metabolism of dicyclomine was not studied. The principal route of excretion is via the urine (79.5% of the dose). Excretion also occurs in the feces, but to a lesser extent (8.4%).

If injection sites are marked in ink, do not inject BOTOX directly through the ink mark to avoid a permanent tattoo effect. Blepharospasm For blepharospasm, reconstituted BOTOX is injected using a sterile, 27-30 gauge needle without electromyographic guidance. The initial recommended dose is 1.25 Units-2.5 Units (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site) injected into the medial and lateral pre- tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. Avoiding injection near the levator palpebrae superioris may reduce the complication of ptosis. Avoiding medial lower lid injections, and thereby reducing diffusion into the inferior oblique, may reduce the complication of diplopia. Ecchymosis occurs easily in the soft eyelid tissues. This can be prevented by applying pressure at the injection site immediately after the injection. The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units/8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units/4 mL (see Table 1)."}

In general, the initial effect of the injections is seen within three days and reaches a peak at one to two weeks post-treatment. Each treatment lasts approximately three months, following which the procedure can be repeated. At repeat treatment sessions, the dose may be increased up to two-fold if the response from the initial treatment is considered insufficient, usually defined as an effect that does not last longer than two months. However, there appears to be little benefit obtainable from injecting more than 5 Units per site. Some tolerance may be found when BOTOX is used in treating blepharospasm if treatments are given any more frequently than every three months, and is rare to have the effect be permanent.

Injection without surgical exposure or electromyographic guidance should not be attempted. Physicians should be familiar with electromyographic technique. To prepare the eye for BOTOX injection, it is recommended that several drops of a local anesthetic and an ocular decongestant be given several minutes prior to injection. The volume of BOTOX injected for treatment of strabismus should be between 0.05-0.15 mL per muscle.

These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity.

Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products The potency Units of BOTOX are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)]. Serious Adverse Reactions with Unapproved Use Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, with some adverse reactions associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received BOTOX injections for unapproved uses.

Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties Treatment with BOTOX and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre- existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised. Treatment with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles.

{"file": "botox_pi.pdf", "page": 28, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "The primary release procedure for BOTOX uses a cell-based potency assay to determine the potency relative to a reference standard. The assay is specific to AbbVie’s products BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic. One Unit of BOTOX corresponds to the calculated median intraperitoneal lethal dose (LD50) in mice. Due to specific details of this assay such as the vehicle, dilution scheme, and laboratory protocols, Units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin or any toxin assessed with any other specific assay method. The specific activity of BOTOX is approximately 20 Units/nanogram of neurotoxin protein complex. Each vial of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection contains either 100 Units of Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex, 0.5 mg of Albumin Human, and 0.9 mg of sodium chloride; or 200 Units of Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex, 1 mg of Albumin Human, and 1.8 mg of sodium chloride in a sterile, vacuum-dried form without a preservative.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action BOTOX blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or autonomic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, BOTOX produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. There is evidence that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation produced by BOTOX. When injected intradermally, BOTOX produces temporary chemical denervation of the sweat gland resulting in local reduction in sweating. Following intradetrusor injection, BOTOX affects the efferent pathways of detrusor activity via inhibition of acetylcholine release.

This study enrolled adult patients with cervical dystonia and a history of having received BOTOX in an open label manner with perceived good response and tolerable side effects. Patients were excluded if they had previously received surgical or other denervation treatment for their symptoms or had a known history of neuromuscular disorder. Subjects participated in an open label enrichment period where they received their previously employed dose of BOTOX.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Hypertension BYSTOLIC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. BYSTOLIC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with BYSTOLIC. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,"}

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. 2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Hypertension The dose of BYSTOLIC must be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial. Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL/min) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.

Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Caution patients without overt coronary artery disease against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other β-blockers, when discontinuation of BYSTOLIC is planned, carefully observe and advise patients to minimize physical activity. Taper BYSTOLIC over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, re-start BYSTOLIC promptly, at least temporarily. 5.2 Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction BYSTOLIC was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent MI. 5.3 Bronchospastic Diseases In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive β-blockers. 5.4 Anesthesia and Major Surgery Because beta-blocker withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of MI and chest pain, patients already on beta-blockers should generally continue treatment throughout the perioperative period.

If BYSTOLIC is to be continued perioperatively, monitor patients closely when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If β-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The β-blocking effects of BYSTOLIC can be reversed by β-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with β-blockers. 5.5 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment."}

DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Use caution when BYSTOLIC is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. 7.2 Hypotensive Agents Do not use BYSTOLIC with other β-blockers. Closely monitor patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, because the added β-blocking action of BYSTOLIC may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving BYSTOLIC and clonidine, discontinue BYSTOLIC for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine. 7.3 Digitalis Glycosides Both digitalis glycosides and β-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. 7.4 Calcium Channel Blockers BYSTOLIC can exacerbate the effects of myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide. 8.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data regarding use of BYSTOLIC in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate [see Clinical Considerations]. Oral administration of nebivolol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and perinatal lethality at doses approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage).

At 5 mg/kg and higher doses (1.2 times the MRHD), prolonged gestation, dystocia and reduced maternal care were produced with corresponding increases in late fetal deaths and stillbirths and decreased birth weight, live litter size and pup survival. These events occurred only when nebivolol was given during the perinatal period (late gestation, parturition and lactation). Insufficient numbers of pups survived at 5 mg/kg to evaluate the offspring for reproductive performance.

Nebivolol is present in rat milk [see Data]. Because of the potential for β- blockers to produce serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, especially bradycardia, BYSTOLIC is not recommended during nursing. Data In lactating rats, maximum milk levels of unchanged nebivolol were observed at 4 hours after single and repeat doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day.

No mortality was seen at half the adult human exposure. In surviving rats, cardiomyopathy was seen at exposures greater than or equal to the human exposure. Male rat pups exposed to twice the human exposure showed decreases in total sperm count as well as decreases in the total and percentage of motile sperm. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2800 patients in the U.S. sponsored placebo-controlled clinical hypertension studies, 478 patients were 65 years of age or older.

However, if heart failure worsens consider discontinuation of BYSTOLIC. 10. OVERDOSAGE In clinical trials and worldwide postmarketing experience there were reports of BYSTOLIC overdose. The most common signs and symptoms associated with BYSTOLIC overdosage are bradycardia and hypotension. Other important adverse reactions reported with BYSTOLIC overdose include cardiac failure, dizziness, hypoglycemia, fatigue and vomiting. Other adverse reactions associated with β-blocker overdose include bronchospasm and heart block. The largest known ingestion of BYSTOLIC worldwide involved a patient who ingested up to 500 mg of BYSTOLIC along with several 100 mg tablets of acetylsalicylic acid in a suicide attempt.

If the response is inadequate, isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transthoracic or transvenous pacemaker placement may be necessary. Hypotension: Administer IV fluids and vasopressors. Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Heart Block (second or third degree): Monitor and treat with isoproterenol infusion. Under some circumstances, transthoracic or transvenous pacemaker placement may be necessary. Congestive Heart Failure: Initiate therapy with digitalis glycoside and diuretics. In certain cases, consider the use of inotropic and vasodilating agents. Bronchospasm: Administer bronchodilator therapy such as a short acting inhaled β2-agonist and/or aminophylline. Hypoglycemia: Administer IV glucose.

DESCRIPTION The chemical name for the active ingredient in BYSTOLIC (nebivolol) tablets is (1RS,1’RS)-1,1’-[(2RS,2’SR)- bis(6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-yl)]- 2,2’-iminodiethanol hydrochloride. Nebivolol is a racemate composed of d-Nebivolol and l-Nebivolol with the stereochemical designations of [SRRR]-nebivolol and [RSSS]- nebivolol, respectively. Nebivolol’s molecular formula is (C22H25F2NO4•HCl) with the following structural formula:"}

BYSTOLIC as tablets for oral administration contains nebivolol hydrochloride equivalent to 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg of nebivolol base. In addition, BYSTOLIC contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, D&C Red #27 Lake, FD&C Blue #2 Lake, FD&C Yellow #6 Lake, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, polysorbate 80, and sodium lauryl sulfate. 12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Nebivolol is a β-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. In extensive metabolizers (most of the population) and at doses less than or equal to 10 mg, nebivolol is preferentially β1 selective. In poor metabolizers and at higher doses, nebivolol inhibits both β1 - and β2 - adrenergic receptors.

In poor metabolizers and at higher doses, nebivolol inhibits both β1 - and β2 - adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, BYSTOLIC does not demonstrate 1-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to β-blocking activity. 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of the antihypertensive response of BYSTOLIC has not been definitively established. Possible factors that may be involved include: (1) decreased heart rate, (2) decreased myocardial contractility, (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers, (4) suppression of renin activity and (5) vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to β-blocking activity.

Plasma levels of d–nebivolol increase in proportion to dose in EMs and PMs for doses up to 20mg. Exposure to l-nebivolol is higher than to d-nebivolol but l-nebivolol contributes little to the drug’s activity as d-nebivolol’s beta receptor affinity is > 1000-fold higher than l-nebivolol. For the same dose, PMs attain a 5-fold higher Cmax and 10-fold higher AUC of d-nebivolol than do EMs. d-Nebivolol accumulates about 1.5-fold with repeated once-daily dosing in EMs. Absorption Absorption of BYSTOLIC is similar to an oral solution. The absolute bioavailability has not been determined."}

Under fed conditions, nebivolol glucuronides are slightly reduced. BYSTOLIC may be administered without regard to meals. Distribution The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations. Metabolism Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N- dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. Its stereospecific metabolites contribute to the pharmacologic activity [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Elimination After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs. Essentially all nebivolol was excreted as multiple oxidative metabolites or their corresponding glucuronide conjugates. 12.4 Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Hepatic Disease d-Nebivolol peak plasma concentration increased 3-fold, exposure (AUC) increased 10-fold, and the apparent clearance decreased by 86% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).

Blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too great. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood through the body and causes damage to the blood vessels. BYSTOLIC tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower your blood pressure lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack.

Discontinue CANASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy. [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with CANASA. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to CANASA or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities.

If concomitant use of CANASA and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference With Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid.

There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of CANASA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for CANASA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CANASA or from the underlying maternal conditions.

The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5- aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CANASA in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. CANASA was evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis.

Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as CANASA who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients.

Discontinue CANASA if renal function deteriorates while on therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE Mesalamine absorption from the colon is limited; however, CANASA is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement.

{"file": "canasa_pi.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "The active ingredient in CANASA 1000 mg suppositories for rectal use is mesalamine, also known as mesalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and is classified as an aminosalicylate. Each CANASA rectal suppository contains 1000 mg of mesalamine (USP) in a base of Hard Fat, NF. The empirical formula is C7H7NO3, representing a molecular weight of 153.14. The structural formula is: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state.

The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (Cmin) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma. Distribution Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent. Elimination In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5- ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA). Metabolism The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall.

Excretion Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose.

CARAFATE Oral Suspension for oral administration contains 1 g of sucralfate per 10 mL. CARAFATE Oral Suspension also contains: colloidal silicon dioxide NF, FD&C Red #40, flavor, glycerin USP, methylcellulose USP, methylparaben NF, microcrystalline cellulose NF, purified water USP, simethicone emulsion USP, and sorbitol solution USP. Therapeutic category: antiulcer. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amounts of the sulfated disaccharide that are absorbed are excreted primarily in the urine. Although the mechanism of sucralfate’s ability to accelerate healing of duodenal ulcers remains to be fully defined, it is known that it exerts its effect through a local, rather than systemic, action. The following observations also appear pertinent: 1. Studies in human subjects and with animal models of ulcer disease have shown that sucralfate forms an ulcer-adherent complex with proteinaceous exudate at the ulcer site. 2. In vitro, a sucralfate-albumin film provides a barrier to diffusion of hydrogen ions. 3. In human subjects, sucralfate given in doses recommended for ulcer therapy inhibits pepsin activity in gastric juice by 32%. In vitro, sucralfate adsorbs"}

In human subjects, sucralfate given in doses recommended for ulcer therapy inhibits pepsin activity in gastric juice by 32%. In vitro, sucralfate adsorbs bile salts. These observations suggest that sucralfate’s antiulcer activity is the result of formation of an ulcer- adherent complex that covers the ulcer site and protects it against further attack by acid, pepsin, and bile salts. There are approximately 14 to 16 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity per 1 g dose of sucralfate. CLINICAL TRIALS In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of CARAFATE Oral Suspension, a dosage regimen of 1 gram (10 mL) four times daily was demonstrated to be superior to placebo in ulcer healing."}

Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients. Close monitoring of glycemia in diabetic patients treated with CARAFATE Oral Suspension is recommended. Adjustment of the anti-diabetic treatment dose during the use of CARAFATE Oral Suspension might be necessary. Special Populations: Chronic Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients When sucralfate is administered orally, small amounts of aluminum are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Concomitant use of sucralfate with other products that contain aluminum, such as aluminum-containing antacids, may increase the total body burden of aluminum. Patients with normal renal function receiving the recommended doses of sucralfate and aluminum- containing products adequately excrete aluminum in the urine. Patients with chronic renal failure or those receiving dialysis have impaired excretion of absorbed aluminum. In addition, aluminum does not cross dialysis membranes because it is bound to albumin and transferrin plasma proteins.

Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy. The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all cases studied to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Due to CARAFATE Oral Suspension’s potential to alter the absorption of some drugs, CARAFATE Oral Suspension should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.

Before using DALVANCE, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other glycopeptides. Due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, carefully monitor for signs of hypersensitivity during treatment with DALVANCE in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions DALVANCE is administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of DALVANCE can cause flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, rash, and/or back pain. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions. 5.3 Hepatic Effects In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, more DALVANCE than comparator-treated subjects with normal baseline transaminase levels had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon, and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing DALVANCE in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of"}

Drug Interactions Nonclinical studies demonstrated that dalbavancin is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 isoenzymes. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, dalbavancin pharmacokinetics were not affected by co-administration with known CYP450 substrates, inducers or inhibitors, nor by individual medications including acetaminophen, aztreonam, fentanyl, metronidazole, furosemide, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole), midazolam, and simvastatin. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Dalbavancin, a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide, interferes with cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the stem pentapeptide in nascent cell wall peptidoglycan, thus preventing cross-linking.

If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, patients should contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including DALVANCE should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When DALVANCE is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by DALVANCE or other antibacterial drugs in the future [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Chemical Name Fluorometholone: 9-Fluoro-11ß, 17-dihydroxy-6-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione Structural Formula Contains Active: fluorometholone 0.25%. Preservative: benzalkonium chloride 0.005%. Inactives: edetate disodium; polysorbate 80; polyvinyl alcohol 1.4%; purified water; sodium chloride; sodium phosphate, dibasic; sodium phosphate, monobasic; and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. FML FORTE® suspension is formulated with a pH from 6.2 to 7.5. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure."}

Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. In clinical studies of documented steroid- responders, fluorometholone demonstrated a significantly longer average time to produce a rise in intraocular pressure than dexamethasone phosphate; however, in a small percentage of individuals, a significant rise in intraocular pressure occurred within one week. The ultimate magnitude of the rise was equivalent for both drugs."}

CONTRAINDICATIONS FML FORTE® suspension is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. FML FORTE® suspension is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids. WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase intraocular pressure in susceptible individuals, resulting in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may also suppress the host immune response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning. Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. If this product"}

Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure should be checked frequently. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended.

Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue HUMIRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before HUMIRA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to HUMIRA use. • Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti- fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. • Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.

Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of HUMIRA and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Treatment with HUMIRA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection.

There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with HUMIRA.

Although MTX reduced the apparent adalimumab clearance, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either HUMIRA or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of HUMIRA with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11)]. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker.

It is possible for a molecule that antagonizes cytokine activity, such as adalimumab, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of HUMIRA in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."}

Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby HUMIRA Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD). Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease- matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design.

Sodium hydroxide is added as necessary to adjust pH. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab does not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with HUMIRA may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which HUMIRA exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X"}

A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after HUMIRA administration.

Estrogen and progestin combinations, including the estradiol/norethindrone acetate component of ORIAHNN, increase the risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders, including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction, especially in women at high risk for these events. In general, the risk is greatest among women over 35 years of age who smoke, and women with uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular disease, or obesity. Discontinue ORIAHNN if an arterial or venous thrombotic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular event occurs or is suspected. If feasible, discontinue ORIAHNN at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Stop ORIAHNN immediately if there is sudden unexplained partial or complete loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis as these have been reported in patients receiving estrogens and progestins. 5.2 Bone Loss ORIAHNN is contraindicated in women with known osteoporosis [see Contraindications (4)].

ORIAHNN may cause a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) in some patients. BMD loss is greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible after stopping treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In the Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies UF-1, UF-2, and UF-3) [see Clinical Studies (14)], seven out of 453 (1.5%) ORIAHNN-treated women experienced fractures, including one (0.2%) with a fragility fracture, compared to one out of 196 (0.5%) placebo-treated women (patient had a non- fragility fracture). Five of the seven ORIAHNN-treated women reported these fractures in the post-treatment follow-up period. The impact of BMD decreases on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in premenopausal women is unknown. Consider the benefits and risks of ORIAHNN treatment in patients with a history of a low- trauma fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss, including taking medications that may decrease BMD (e.g., systemic or chronic inhaled corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, or proton pump inhibitors). Assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended at baseline and periodically thereafter. Consider discontinuing ORIAHNN if the risk associated with"}

Consider discontinuing ORIAHNN if the risk associated with bone loss exceeds the potential benefit of treatment. Limit the duration of use to 24 months to reduce the extent of bone loss [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation for patients with inadequate dietary intake may be beneficial. 5.3 Hormonally-Sensitive Malignancies ORIAHNN is contraindicated in women with current or history of breast cancer and in women at increased risk for hormonally-sensitive malignancies, such as those with mutations in BRCA genes [see Contraindications (4)]."}

No breast cancer cases were seen in placebo- treated women [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The use of estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. Surveillance measures, such as breast examinations and regular mammography, are recommended. Discontinue ORIAHNN if a hormonally-sensitive malignancy is diagnosed. 5.4 Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Behavior, and Exacerbation of Mood Disorders In Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies UF-1 and UF-2), ORIAHNN-treated women had a higher incidence (3%) of depression, depressed mood, and/or tearfulness compared to placebo-treated women (1%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Suicidal ideation and behavior, including a completed suicide, occurred in women treated with lower doses of elagolix in clinical trials conducted for a different indication.

More frequent monitoring in ORIAHNN-treated women with prediabetes and diabetes may be needed. In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Use of elagolix is associated with increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and serum triglycerides. Monitor lipid levels and consider discontinuing ORIAHNN if hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia worsens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Alopecia In Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies UF-1 and UF-2), more women experienced alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning with ORIAHNN (3.5%) compared to placebo (1.0%). In almost one-third (4/14) of affected ORIAHNN-treated women, alopecia was a reason for discontinuing treatment. No specific pattern was described.

Additionally, the use of elagolix (a component of ORIAHNN) in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, compared to patients with normal hepatic function, increased elagolix exposures 3-fold and 7-fold, respectively, and this increases the risk of elagolix-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."}

Elagolix is a GnRH receptor antagonist that inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration of elagolix results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to decreased blood concentrations of the ovarian sex hormones estradiol and progesterone and reduces bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. E2 acts by binding to nuclear receptors that are expressed in estrogen-responsive tissues. As a component of ORIAHNN, the addition of exogenous estradiol may reduce the increase in bone resorption and resultant bone loss that can occur due to a decrease in circulating estrogen from elagolix alone. Progestins such as NETA act by binding to nuclear receptors that are expressed in progesterone- responsive tissues. As a component of ORIAHNN, NETA may protect the uterus from the potential adverse endometrial effects of unopposed estrogen. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Estradiol and norethindrone acetate (components of ORIAHNN) may have the following effects: • Increased thyroxin-binding globulin levels leading to [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]:  Increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), thyroxine (T4)"}

In a fertility study conducted in the rat, there was no effect of elagolix on fertility at any dose (50, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day). Based on AUC, the exposure multiple for the MRHD in women compared to the highest dose of 300 mg/kg/day in female rats is approximately 2.9-fold. However, because elagolix has low affinity for the GnRH receptor in the rat [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)], and because effects on fertility are most likely to be mediated via the GnRH receptor, these data have low relevance to humans.

Topical ocular administration of dexamethasone in mice and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced cleft palate and embryofetal death in mice, and malformations of the abdominal wall/intestines and kidneys in rabbits at doses 5 and 4 times higher than the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) of OZURDEX® (0.7 milligrams dexamethasone), respectively. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Topical ocular administration of 0.15% dexamethasone (0.75 mg/kg/day) on gestational days 10 to 13 produced embryofetal lethality and a high incidence of cleft palate in mice. A dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day in the mouse is approximately 5 times an OZURDEX® injection in humans (0.7 mg dexamethasone) on a mg/m2 basis. In rabbits, topical ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone throughout organogenesis (0.20 mg/kg/day, on gestational day 6 followed by 0.13 mg/kg/day on gestational days 7-18) produced intestinal anomalies, intestinal aplasia, gastroschisis and hypoplastic kidneys.

There is no information regarding the presence of dexamethasone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production to inform risk of OZURDEX® to an infant during lactation. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother’s clinical need for OZURDEX® and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from OZURDEX®. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OZURDEX® in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients. 11 DESCRIPTION OZURDEX®"}

The NOVADUR® system contains two poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) polymer excipients. Both of these polymer materials have the same PLGA backbone, but the terminal end groups differ between them. One polymer, DL- Lactide and Glycolide (50:50) Copolymer 12000 Ethyl Ester, is ester terminated, and the other DL-Lactide and Glycolide (50:50) Copolymer 12000 Acid is acid terminated. The chemical name for dexamethasone is Pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 9-fluoro-11,17,21-trihydroxy-16- methyl-, (11β,16α)-. Its structural formula is: MW 392.47; molecular formula: C22H29FO5 Dexamethasone occurs as a white to cream-colored crystalline powder having not more than a slight odor, and is practically insoluble in water and very soluble in alcohol. The PLGA matrix slowly degrades to lactic acid and glycolic acid. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been shown to suppress inflammation by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines resulting in decreased edema, fibrin deposition, capillary leakage and migration of inflammatory cells. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma concentrations were obtained from 21 patients with macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and 21 patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) prior to"}

Reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema, have been reported with use of QULIPTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Hypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

Monitor patients treated with QULIPTA for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of QULIPTA is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5.3 Raynaud’s Phenomenon Development of Raynaud’s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. QULIPTA should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms."}

The safety of QULIPTA was evaluated in 2657 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of QULIPTA. Of these, 1225 patients were exposed to QULIPTA for at least 6 months, and 826 patients were exposed for 12 months.

Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1-833-277-0206 or visiting http://empresspregnancyregistry.com. Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of QULIPTA in pregnant women. In animal studies, oral administration of atogepant during the period of organogenesis (rats and rabbits) or throughout pregnancy and lactation (rats) resulted in adverse developmental effects (decreased fetal and offspring body weight in rats; increased incidence of fetal structural variations in rabbits) at exposures greater than those used clinically [see Data].

The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Data Animal Data Oral administration of atogepant (0, 5, 15, 125, or 750 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreases in fetal body weight and in skeletal ossification at the two highest doses tested (125 and 750 mg/kg), which were not associated with maternal toxicity.

Clinical studies of QULIPTA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For chronic migraine, avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of QULIPTA is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient of QULIPTA is atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. The chemical name of atogepant is (3’S)-N-[(3S,5S,6R)-6-methyl-2-oxo-1- (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-5-(2,3,6-trifluorophenyl)piperidin-3-yl]-2’-oxo-1’,2’,5,7- tetrahydrospiro[cyclopenta[b]pyridine-6,3’-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-3-carboxamide, and it has the following structural formula: The molecular formula is C29H23F6N5O3 and molecular weight is 603.5. Atogepant is a white to off-white powder. It is freely soluble in ethanol, soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in acetonitrile, and practically insoluble in water.

Atogepant displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics up to 170 mg per day (approximately 3 times the highest recommended dosage), with no accumulation. Effect of Food When QULIPTA was administered with a high-fat meal, the food effect was not significant (AUC and Cmax were reduced by approximately 18% and 22%, respectively, with no effect on median time to maximum atogepant plasma concentration). QULIPTA was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies. Distribution Plasma protein binding of atogepant was not concentration-dependent in the range of 0.1 to 10 µM; the unbound fraction of atogepant was approximately 4.7% in human plasma. The mean apparent volume of distribution of atogepant (Vz/F) after oral administration is approximately 292 L. Elimination Metabolism Atogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. The parent compound (atogepant), and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite (M23) were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma.

Excretion The elimination half-life of atogepant is approximately 11 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of atogepant is approximately 19 L/hr. Following single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-atogepant to healthy male subjects, 42% and 5% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atogepant in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of atogepant in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-89 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal function (CLcr >90 mL/min).

Other Specific Populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and body weight did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (Cmax and AUC) of atogepant. Therefore, no dose adjustments are warranted based on these factors. Drug Interactions In Vitro Studies Enzymes In vitro, atogepant is not an inhibitor for CYPs 3A4, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations.

Atogepant is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, NTCP, BSEP, MRP3, or MRP4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Atogepant is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and MATE1. No clinical drug interactions are expected for atogepant as a perpetrator with these transporters. In Vivo Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Co-administration of QULIPTA with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a clinically significant increase (Cmax by 2.15-fold and AUC by 5.5-fold) in the exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

RAPAFLO is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose is 8 mg orally once daily with a meal. Patients who have difficulty swallowing pills and capsules may carefully open the RAPAFLO capsule and sprinkle the powder inside on a tablespoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should be swallowed immediately (within 5 minutes) without chewing and followed with an 8 oz glass of cool water to ensure complete swallowing of the powder. The applesauce used should not be hot, and it should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. Any powder/applesauce mixture should be used immediately (within 5 minutes) and not stored for future use. Subdividing the contents of a RAPAFLO capsule is not recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Adjustment in Special Populations Renal impairment: RAPAFLO is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr < 30 mL/min).

As with other alpha-blockers, there is potential for syncope. Patients should be cautioned about driving, operating machinery, or performing hazardous tasks when initiating therapy [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2), and PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)]. 5.2 Renal Impairment In a clinical pharmacology study, plasma concentrations (AUC and Cmax) of silodosin were approximately three times higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function, while half-lives of silodosin doubled in duration. The dose of RAPAFLO should be reduced to 4 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment. Exercise caution and monitor such patients for adverse events [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. RAPAFLO is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Impairment RAPAFLO has not been tested in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and therefore, should not be prescribed to such patients [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.4 Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions In a drug interaction study, co-administration of a single 8 mg dose"}

Concomitant use of ketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) is therefore contraindicated [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. 5.5 Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions The pharmacodynamic interactions between silodosin and other alpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and RAPAFLO should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)]. A specific pharmacodynamic interaction study between silodosin and antihypertensive agents has not been performed. However, patients in the Phase 3 clinical studies taking concomitant antihypertensive medications with RAPAFLO did not experience a significant increase in the incidence of syncope, dizziness, or orthostasis. Nevertheless, exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible adverse events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)]. Caution is"}

Therefore, patients thought to have BPH should be examined prior to starting therapy with RAPAFLO to rule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate. 5.7 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on alpha-1 blockers or previously treated with alpha-1 blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents; progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs; and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. Patients planning cataract surgery should be told to inform their ophthalmologist that they are taking RAPAFLO [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. 5.8 Laboratory Test Interactions No laboratory test interactions were observed during clinical evaluations.

The dose-limiting adverse event was postural hypotension. Should overdose of RAPAFLO lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by maintaining the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, administration of intravenous fluid should be considered. If necessary, vasopressors could be used, and renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Dialysis is unlikely to be of significant benefit since silodosin is highly (97%) protein bound. 11 DESCRIPTION RAPAFLO is the brand name for silodosin, a selective antagonist of alpha-1 adrenoreceptors. The chemical name of silodosin is 1-(3-Hydroxypropyl)-5-[(2R)-2-({2-[2-(2,2,2- trifluoroethoxy)phenoxy]ethyl}amino)propyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-7-carboxamide and the molecular formula is C25H32F3N3O4 with a molecular weight of 495.53. The structural formula of silodosin is: Silodosin is a white to pale yellowish white powder that melts at approximately 105 to 109°C.

The 24 mg dose of RAPAFLO was selected to achieve blood levels of silodosin that may be seen in a “worst-case” scenario exposure (i.e., in the setting of concomitant renal disease or use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. QT interval was measured during a 24-hour period following dosing on Day 5 (at silodosin steady state).

Elimination Metabolism Silodosin undergoes extensive metabolism through glucuronidation, alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) pathways. The main metabolite of silodosin is a glucuronide conjugate (KMD-3213G) that is formed via direct conjugation of silodosin by UDP- glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7). Co-administration with inhibitors of UGT2B7 (e.g., probenecid, valproic acid, fluconazole) may potentially increase exposure to silodosin. KMD-3213G, which has been shown in vitro to be active, has an extended half-life (approximately 24 hours) and reaches plasma exposure (AUC) approximately four times greater than that of silodosin. The second major metabolite (KMD-3293) is formed via alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases and reaches plasma exposures similar to that of silodosin. KMD-3293 is not expected to contribute significantly to the overall pharmacologic activity of RAPAFLO."}

Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use. • Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. • Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. The risks and benefits of treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Monitor patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, pJIA, or giant cell arteritis closely for adverse reactions when co-administering RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. For patients with atopic dermatitis, coadministration of RINVOQ 30 mg once daily with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. For patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, reduce the RINVOQ induction dosage to 30 mg once daily. The recommended maintenance dosage is 15 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Upadacitinib exposure is decreased when it is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampin), which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression.

Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Upadacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In a cell-free isolated enzyme assay, upadacitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1 and JAK2 relative to JAK3 and TYK2. In human leukocyte cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1 and JAK1/JAK3 more potently than JAK2/JAK2 mediated STAT phosphorylation. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of IL-6 Induced STAT3 and IL-7 Induced STAT5 Phosphorylation In healthy volunteers, the administration of upadacitinib (immediate release formulation) resulted in a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2)-induced STAT3 and IL-7 (JAK1/JAK3)-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in whole blood.

If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue SKYRIZI and initiate appropriate therapy immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Infections SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Treatment with SKYRIZI should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing SKYRIZI. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer SKYRIZI until the infection resolves. 5.3 Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, including other risankizumab products, may be misleading.

IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Risankizumab-rzaa inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted with risankizumab-rzaa. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Risankizumab-rzaa plasma concentrations, after single dose administration increased dose proportionally from 18 mg to 360 mg when administered subcutaneously (0.12 to 2.4 times the lowest recommended dose and 0.05 to 1 times the highest recommended dose) and from 200 mg to 1,800 mg when administered as an up to 3-hour intravenous infusion (0.2 to 3 times the recommended dose) in healthy subjects. In subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with 150 mg subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, steady-state peak concentration (Cmax) and trough concentration (Ctrough) are estimated to be 12 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL, respectively.

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab-rzaa in subjects with ulcerative colitis was generally similar to that in subjects with Crohn’s disease.

Metabolism The metabolic pathway of risankizumab-rzaa has not been characterized. As a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab-rzaa is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Risankizumab-rzaa exposures (Ctrough) in geriatric patients (≥65 years) are comparable to those in younger adult patients within each indication. No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab-rzaa. Body Weight Risankizumab-rzaa clearance and volume of distribution increase and plasma concentrations decrease as body weight increases; however, no dose adjustment is recommended based on body weight.

The mean difference (95% CI) from placebo in HAQ-DI change from baseline at Week 24 was -0.20 (-0.26, -0.14) in study PsA-1 and -0.16 (-0.26, -0.07) in study PsA-2. In both studies, a greater proportion of subjects achieved a reduction of at least 0.35 in HAQ-DI score from baseline in the SKYRIZI group compared with placebo at Week 24.

In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage (10)]. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism. Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

Overtreatment or undertreatment with SYNTHROID may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism in adult or pediatric patients. In pediatric patients with congenital and acquired hypothyroidism, undertreatment may adversely affect cognitive development and linear growth, and overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis and acceleration of bone age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Titrate the dose of SYNTHROID carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.4 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with SYNTHROID [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements.

Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours apart from these agents. Orlistat Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and SYNTHROID for changes in thyroid function. Bile Acid Sequestrants (e.g., colesevelam, cholestyramine, colestipol) Ion Exchange Resins (e.g., Kayexalate) Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease levothyroxine absorption. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Proton Pump Inhibitors Sucralfate Antacids (e.g., aluminum & magnesium hydroxides, simethicone) Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for adequate absorption of levothyroxine. Sucralfate, antacids and proton pump inhibitors may cause hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric pH, and reduce levothyroxine absorption. Monitor patients appropriately. Table 6.

Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol > 160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (> 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone > 4 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (See above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of SYNTHROID therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent"}

Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants SYNTHROID increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the SYNTHROID dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides SYNTHROID may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and SYNTHROID may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines.

Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and SYNTHROID dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with levothyroxine sodium. SYNTHROID should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the SYNTHROID dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Published studies report that levothyroxine is present in human milk following the administration of oral levothyroxine. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant have been reported and there is no information on the effects of levothyroxine on milk production. Adequate levothyroxine treatment during lactation may normalize milk production in hypothyroid lactating mothers with low milk supply.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of SYNTHROID therapy for cardiac overload and arrhythmias. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate SYNTHROID at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly. 10 OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby"}

{"file": "synthroid.pdf", "page": 17, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the SYNTHROID dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. The relative bioavailability of SYNTHROID tablets, compared to an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 93%. T4 absorption is increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as soybeans. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T4. Absorption may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T4 absorption [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Distribution Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in"}

Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Elimination Metabolism T4 is slowly eliminated (see Table 10). The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3, with T4 deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and rT3 are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces.

CONTRAINDICATIONS Teflaro is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftaroline or other members of the cephalosporin class. Anaphylaxis has been reported with ceftaroline. 5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with Teflaro is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Maintain clinical supervision if this product is to be given to a penicillin- or other beta-lactam- allergic patient, because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial agents has been clearly established. If an allergic reaction to Teflaro occurs, discontinue Teflaro and institute appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.2 Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including Teflaro, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Neurological Adverse Reactions Neurological adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients treated with cephalosporins, including Teflaro. These reactions include encephalopathy and seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment.

No adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group. Seroconversion from a negative to a positive direct Coombs’ test result occurred in 42/234 (17.9%) of children receiving Teflaro and 3/93 (3.2%) of patients receiving comparator drugs in the three pooled pediatric trials. No adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group. If anemia develops during or after treatment with Teflaro, drug-induced hemolytic anemia should be considered. Diagnostic studies including a direct Coombs’ test, should be performed. If drug-induced hemolytic anemia is suspected, discontinuation of Teflaro should be considered and supportive care should be administered to the patient (i.e. transfusion) if clinically indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Teflaro in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug- resistant bacteria. 6.

Elderly subjects had greater ceftaroline exposure relative to non-elderly subjects when administered the same single dose of Teflaro.

Its molecular weight is 762.75. The empirical formula is C22H21N8O8PS4.C2H4O2.H2O. Figure 1: Chemical structure of ceftaroline fosamil Teflaro vials contain either 600 mg or 400 mg of anhydrous ceftaroline fosamil (equivalent to 668 mg and 446 mg, respectively, of ceftaroline fosamil monoacetate monohydrate). The powder for injection is formulated from ceftaroline fosamil monoacetate monohydrate, a pale yellowish-white to light yellow sterile powder. Each vial of 400 mg of anhydrous ceftaroline fosamil includes inactive ingredient L-arginine 263.3 mg/vial as the solubilizer and alkalizing agent.

The bactericidal action of ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftaroline is bactericidal against S. aureus due to its affinity for PBP2a and against Streptococcus pneumoniae due to its affinity for PBP2x. Resistance Ceftaroline is not active against Gram-negative bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) from the TEM, SHV or CTX-M families, serine carbapenemases (such as KPC), class B metallo- beta-lactamases, or class C (AmpC cephalosporinases). Although cross-resistance may occur, some isolates resistant to other cephalosporins may be susceptible to ceftaroline. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have not demonstrated any antagonism between ceftaroline or other commonly used antibacterial agents (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, levofloxacin, azithromycin, amikacin, aztreonam, tigecycline,"}

They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Teflaro is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Teflaro or other antibacterial drugs in the future.  Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including Teflaro and usually resolves when the drug is discontinued.

Limitations of Use  Markedly elevated levels of serum TG (e.g., > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].  Fenofibrate did not reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in two large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Prior to Initiation of Trilipix  Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high TG levels and manage as appropriate.  Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Trilipix, and should continue this diet during treatment with Trilipix.  In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting"}

Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules.  Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Trilipix. Discontinue Trilipix in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment.  If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.  Advise patients to take Trilipix at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment  Assess renal function prior to initiation of Trilipix and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dosage of 45 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dosage.  Trilipix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), including those with"}

Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with fenofibrate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Fenofibrate did not reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity or mortality in two large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between fenofibrates, including Trilipix; pemafibrate; clofibrate; and gemfibrozil; the findings in 5 large randomized, placebo- controlled clinical trials with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to Trilipix. Pemafibrate did not reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity or mortality in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background statin therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In the Coronary Drug Project, a large trial conducted from 1965 to 1985 in men post myocardial infarction, there was no difference in mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction between the clofibrate group and the placebo group after 5 years of treatment (NCT00000482)."}

In a trial conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 1965 to 1976, men without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional 1 year. There was a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p ≤ 0.01). Excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis. The Helsinki Heart Study, conducted from 1982 to 1987, was a large (N = 4,081) trial of middle- aged men without a history of coronary artery disease. Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5-year open extension afterward. Total mortality was numerically but not statistically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group versus placebo [95% confidence interval (CI) of the hazard ratio (HR) 0.91 to 1.64].

DILI has been reported within the first few weeks of treatment or after several months of therapy and in some cases has reversed with discontinuation of Trilipix treatment. Patients with DILI have experienced signs"}
{"file": "trilipix_pi.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "and symptoms including dark urine, abnormal stool, jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, myalgia, weight loss, pruritus, and nausea. Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis. In clinical trials, an intermediate daily dosage or the maximum recommended daily dosage of fenofibrate have been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Trilipix is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities. Monitor patient’s liver function, including serum ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, at baseline and periodically for the duration of therapy with Trilipix. Discontinue Trilipix if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist (ALT or AST > 3 times the upper limit of normal, or if accompanied by elevation of bilirubin). Do not restart Trilipix in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury. 5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Trilipix may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine"}

Do not restart Trilipix in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury. 5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Trilipix may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or older, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Data from observational studies indicate that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, including fenofibrates, are co-administered with a statin. Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit of further alterations in TG levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with Trilipix co-administered with colchicine. Consider whether the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with Trilipix outweighs the increased risk of myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue Trilipix if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if Trilipix is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue Trilipix in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the Trilipix dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever."}

These increases tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of Trilipix. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking Trilipix. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking Trilipix at risk for renal insufficiency such as geriatric patients and patients with diabetes. Trilipix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Cholelithiasis Fenofibrate may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Trilipix therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found. Trilipix is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing gallbladder disease. 5.6 Increased Bleeding Risk with Coumarin Anticoagulants Exercise caution when co-administering anticoagulants with Trilipix because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects in prolonging the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). To prevent bleeding complications, monitor the PT/INR frequently and adjust the dosage of the anticoagulant until the PT/INR has stabilized [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.7 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been"}

This occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct. 5.8 Hematologic Changes Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of therapy with fenofibrates. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in individuals treated with Trilipix. Periodic monitoring of red and white blood cell counts is recommended during the first 12 months of Trilipix administration. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Acute Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of fenofibrates. In some cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction, advise them to seek immediate medical attention and discontinue Trilipix."}

The cases of DRESS were associated with cutaneous reactions (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis) and a combination of eosinophilia, fever, systemic organ involvement (renal, hepatic, or respiratory). Discontinue Trilipix and treat patients appropriately if SCAR is suspected. 5.10 Venothromboembolic Disease In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate- than the placebo-treated group. Of 9,795 patients enrolled in FIELD, there were 4,900 in the placebo group and 4,895 in the fenofibrate group. For DVT, there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1.4%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.074); and for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1.1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.022).

In the cardiovascular outcome trial with pemafibrate, pulmonary embolism was reported for 37 (0.7%) subjects in the pemafibrate group and 16 (0.3%) subjects in the placebo group. Deep vein thrombosis was reported for 36 (0.7%) subjects in the pemafibrate group and 13 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group. 5.11 Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels There have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (as low as 2 mg/dL) occurring in patients with and without diabetes initiated on fibrate therapy, including fenofibrate. The decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. This decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy.

The safety of Trilipix has been established in adults with hypertriglyceridemia or primary hyperlipidemia based on adequate and well-controlled trials of other formulations of fenofibrate, referenced below as “fenofibrate” [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Dosages of fenofibrate used in these trials were comparable to Trilipix 135 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Trilipix Statins Clinical Impact: Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with statins. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using Trilipix concomitantly with statin therapy outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dosage titration of statin therapy. Colchicine Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with fenofibrates. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with Trilipix outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

The dosage of the anticoagulants should be reduced to maintain the PT/INR at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent PT/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the PT/INR has stabilized Immunosuppressants Clinical Impact: Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including Trilipix, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. Intervention: The benefits and risks of using Trilipix with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dosage employed and renal function monitored.

In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity was observed with oral administration of fenofibrate in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses less than or comparable to the maximum recommended clinical dosage of 135 mg of Trilipix daily, based on body surface area (mg/m2). Adverse reproductive outcomes occurred at higher doses in the presence of maternal toxicity (see Data). Trilipix should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Fenofibrate is present in the milk of rats and is therefore likely to be present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, such as disruption of infant lipid metabolism, women should not breastfeed during treatment with Trilipix and for 5 days after the final dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Trilipix have not been established in pediatric patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia or primary hyperlipidemia. 8.5 Geriatric Use Assess renal function in geriatric patients and follow contraindications and dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Consider monitoring renal function in geriatric patients taking Trilipix. 8.6 Renal Impairment Trilipix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis. Dosage reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with severe renal impairment have 2.7-fold higher exposure of fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared with healthy volunteers. Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The use of Trilipix has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.

Each delayed release capsule contains choline fenofibrate, equivalent to 45 mg or 135 mg of fenofibric acid. The chemical name for choline fenofibrate is ethanaminium, 2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyl, 2-{4-(4- chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy] -2-methylpropanoate (1:1) with the following structural formula: The empirical formula is C22H28ClNO5 and the molecular weight is 421.91. Choline fenofibrate is freely soluble in water. The melting point is approximately 210°C. Choline fenofibrate is a white to yellow powder, which is stable under ordinary conditions. Each delayed release capsule contains enteric coated mini-tablets comprised of choline fenofibrate and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, methacrylic acid copolymer, povidone, sodium stearyl fumarate, talc, triethyl citrate, water. The capsule shell of the 45 mg capsule contains the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, gelatin, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron oxide.

The pharmacological effects of fenofibric acid in both animals and humans have been studied through oral administration of fenofibrate. The lipid-modifying effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained in vivo in transgenic mice and in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of PPAR alpha receptor. Through this mechanism, fenofibric acid increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity)."}

Fenofibric acid is also the circulating pharmacologically active moiety in plasma after oral administration of fenofibrate, the ester of fenofibric acid. Absorption Fenofibric acid is well absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of fenofibric acid is approximately 81%. Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid occur within 4 to 5 hours after a single dose administration of Trilipix capsule under fasting conditions. Effect of Food Fenofibric acid exposure in plasma, as measured by Cmax and AUC, is not significantly different when a single 135 mg dose of Trilipix is administered under fasting or nonfasting conditions. Distribution Upon multiple dosing of Trilipix, fenofibric acid levels reach steady state within 8 days. Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid at steady state are approximately double those following a single dose. Serum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and dyslipidemic subjects.

Elimination Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 20 hours, allowing once daily administration of Trilipix. Metabolism Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine. In vivo metabolism data after fenofibrate administration indicate that fenofibric acid does not undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent. Excretion After absorption, Trilipix is primarily excreted in the urine in the form of fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients"}

Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of Trilipix has not been studied in pediatric populations. Male and Female Patients No pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibric acid. Racial and Ethnic Groups The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid has not been studied; however, fenofibric acid is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid were examined in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that fenofibric acid is not an inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2A6, and mild-to-moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations.

At a dose of 200 mg/kg/day (at 6 times the MRHD), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes. A statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males at 1 and 6 times the MRHD; an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors was observed at 6 times the MRHD in males. In a second 24-month study in a different strain of rats (Sprague-Dawley), doses of 10 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD) produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes and increases in testicular interstitial cell tumors in males at 2 times the MRHD.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, dyspnea, facial or throat edema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular Disorders: Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], Raynaud’s phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Co-administration of UBRELVY with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in exposure of ubrogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. UBRELVY should not be used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) [see Contraindications (4)].

Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of UBRELVY with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inducers Co-administration of UBRELVY with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in a significant reduction in ubrogepant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, barbiturates, rifampin, St. John’s Wort), loss of ubrogepant efficacy is expected, and concomitant use should be avoided. Co-administration of UBRELVY with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical study. Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of UBRELVY and moderate or weak CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7.3 BCRP and/or P-gp Only Inhibitors Ubrogepant is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp efflux transporters.

Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1-833-277-0206 or visiting http://empresspregnancyregistry.com. Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of UBRELVY in pregnant women. In animal studies, adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed following administration of ubrogepant during pregnancy (increased embryofetal mortality in rabbits) or during pregnancy and lactation (decreased body weight in offspring in rats) at doses greater than those used clinically and which were associated with maternal toxicity (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2% -2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased"}

Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Data Animal Data Oral administration of ubrogepant (0, 1.5, 5, 25, 125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in no adverse effects on embryofetal development. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose tested is approximately 45 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits, ubrogepant (0, 15, 45, 75, or 250 mg/kg/day) was administered orally throughout organogenesis in two separate studies. In both studies, the highest dose tested (250 mg/kg/day) was associated with maternal toxicity. In the first study, ubrogepant produced abortion and increased embryofetal mortality in surviving litters at the high dose (250 mg/kg/day). In the second study, excessive maternal toxicity at the high dose (250 mg/kg/day) resulted in early termination and lack of fetal data for that dose group.

Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (25 mg/kg/day) is approximately 15 times that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from a lactation study in twelve healthy adult females indicate that ubrogepant is excreted in breast milk in low amounts. The estimated relative infant dose is approximately 0.15% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, and the milk-to-plasma ratio is 0.23 (see Data). There are no data on the effects of ubrogepant on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for UBRELVY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from UBRELVY or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data A study was conducted in twelve healthy adult lactating females who were between 24 and 34 years of age and between 1 month and 6 months postpartum. Each subject was administered a single oral dose of ubrogepant 100 mg. Maternal plasma and breast milk were collected for 24 hours after dosing. Using a 150 mL/kg/day estimated infant milk intake, the mean estimated relative infant dose was approximately 0.15% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. The mean milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.23. All subjects had detectable levels of ubrogepant in breast milk during the study; by 16 to 24 hours after dosing, 17% of females in the study had detectable levels of ubrogepant in breast milk. The mean cumulative amount of ubrogepant excreted in breast milk over 24 hours was less than 0.02 mg of a 100 mg dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In pharmacokinetic studies, no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences were observed between elderly and younger subjects.

Avoid use of UBRELVY in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CLcr <15 mL/min). 10 OVERDOSAGE The elimination half-life of ubrogepant is approximately 5 to 7 hours; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with UBRELVY should continue for at least 24 hours, or while symptoms or signs persist. 11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient of UBRELVY is ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. The chemical name of ubrogepant is (3’S)-N-((3S,5S,6R)-6-methyl-2-oxo-5- phenyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)piperidin-3-yl)-2’-oxo-1’,2’,5,7- tetrahydrospiro[cyclopenta[b]pyridine-6,3’-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-3-carboxamide and has the following structural formula: The molecular formula is C29H26F3N5O3 and molecular weight is 549.6. Ubrogepant is a white to off-white powder. It is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, acetone, and acetonitrile; and is practically insoluble in water. UBRELVY is available as tablets for oral administration containing 50 mg or 100 mg ubrogepant. The inactive ingredients include colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate copolymer, sodium"}

Ubrogepant displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Effect of Food When UBRELVY was administered with a high-fat meal, the time to maximum ubrogepant plasma concentration was delayed by 2 hours and resulted in a 22% reduction in Cmax with no change in AUC. UBRELVY was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of ubrogepant is 87% in vitro. The mean apparent central volume of distribution of ubrogepant (V/F) after single dose oral administration is approximately 350 L. Elimination Metabolism Ubrogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. The parent compound (ubrogepant), and 2 glucuronide conjugate metabolites were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma. The glucuronide metabolites are not expected to contribute to the pharmacological activity of ubrogepant since they were reported as about 6000- fold less potent in the CGRP receptor binding assay.

Excretion The elimination half-life of ubrogepant is approximately 5-7 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of ubrogepant is approximately 87 L/hr. Ubrogepant is excreted mostly via the biliary/fecal route, while the renal route is a minor route of elimination. Following single oral dose administration of [14C]-ubrogepant to healthy male subjects, 42% and 6% of the dose was recovered as unchanged ubrogepant in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis based on pooled data from clinical studies was used to evaluate the effect of renal impairment characterized based on estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) using the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation.

Dose adjustment in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) is recommended based on ADME information and a conservative assumption that severe renal impairment is unlikely to cause more than a two-fold increase in exposure of ubrogepant [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. No dosing recommendations can be made for patients with ESRD (CLcr<15 mL/min). Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with pre-existing mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), ubrogepant exposure was increased by 7%, 50%, and 115%, respectively.

Ubrogepant is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporters Ubrogepant is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp transporters in-vitro; therefore, use of inhibitors of BCRP and/or P-gp may increase the exposure of ubrogepant.

Up to 23% of patients were taking preventive medications for migraine at baseline. None of these patients were on concomitant preventive medication that act on the CGRP pathway. The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in patients who treated a migraine with moderate to severe pain. The efficacy of UBRELVY was established by an effect on pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose and most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom at 2 hours post-dose, compared to placebo, for Studies 1 and 2.

Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5- week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may"}

See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule. Reassess the risk of TLS when reinitiating VENCLEXTA after a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up.

VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the ramp-up phase in all patients, and during reinitiation after dosage interruption in patients with CLL/SLL. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS, including fatal cases, has been reported after a single 20 mg dose of VENCLEXTA. In patients with CLL/SLL who followed the current (5-week) dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the"}

TLS, including fatal cases, has been reported after a single 20 mg dose of VENCLEXTA. In patients with CLL/SLL who followed the current (5-week) dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 2% in the VENCLEXTA CLL/SLL monotherapy trials. The rate of TLS remained consistent with VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab. With a 2- to 3-week dose ramp-up and higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included deaths and renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In patients with AML who followed the current 3-day ramp-up dosing schedule and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 1.1% in patients who received VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (VIALE-A). In patients with AML who followed a 4-day ramp-up dosing schedule and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 5.6% and included deaths and renal failure in patients who received VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine (VIALE-C) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function, tumor burden, and type of malignancy. Splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS in patients with CLL/SLL. Assess all patients for risk and provide appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics. Monitor blood chemistries and manage abnormalities promptly. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases. Interrupt dosing if needed; when restarting VENCLEXTA, follow dose modification guidance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

In mice, venetoclax was associated with increased post- implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight at 150 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately 1.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 400 mg once daily). No teratogenicity was observed in either the mouse or the rabbit. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of VENCLEXTA in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Venetoclax was present in the milk when administered to lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with VENCLEXTA and for 1 week after the last dose.

Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL and AML cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer"}

In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has demonstrated cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the exposure response analyses for efficacy, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of response was observed in clinical studies in patients with CLL/SLL, and in patients with AML. Based on the exposure response analyses for safety, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of some safety events was observed in clinical studies in patients with AML. No exposure-safety relationship was observed in patients with CLL/SLL at doses up to 1200 mg given as monotherapy and up to 600 mg given in combination with rituximab. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of VENCLEXTA up to 1200 mg once daily (2 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial in 176 patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. VENCLEXTA had no large effect on QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) and there was no relationship between venetoclax exposure and change in QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Venetoclax mean (± standard deviation) steady state Cmax was 2.1 ± 1.1 mcg/mL and AUC0-24h was 32.8 ±"}

VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including: • Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for TLS when you first start treatment and during treatment with VENCLEXTA. It is important to keep your appointments for blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with VENCLEXTA, including: o fever o chills o nausea o vomiting o confusion o shortness of breath o seizures o irregular heartbeat o dark or cloudy urine o unusual tiredness o muscle or joint pain Drink plenty of water during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of getting"}

Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with ZEMPLAR may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during ZEMPLAR treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause.

In pre-dialysis patients, ZEMPLAR capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with ZEMPLAR, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice."}

Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of ZEMPLAR capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage.

ZEMPLAR is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram or 2 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C27H44O3, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol"}

{"file": "zemplarcappi.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk_id": 1, "text": "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3. Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and"}

The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion."}

This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive ≥ 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium ≥ 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH- based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium ≤ 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% – 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly ≥ 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% – 1.0%).

The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC).

Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female)"}

Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received ZEMPLAR capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145-856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements."}
